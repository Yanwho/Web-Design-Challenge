<h2>This website is a toe in the pool for me.  Prior to this project I had zero working knowledge of HTML, CSS, or BootStrap.</h2>

I was shocked to discover that this was far harder than I imagined it would be.  I figured that the code would be easier to grasp than the likes of python, but I was wrong.  I found it particulalrly challenging because css and bootastrap have so much "built-in" that is not readily referenced.  
As a result, this homework has taken me much much longer than any previous homework.  I pressed on throught the frustration as I was learning much everytime I returned to it and I see that basic understanding of web design is a critical skill that I would be wise to have.
Although very much modeled after the samples in the instructions, I trust you will find a few nuggets of flair and uniqueness I have added.
